Prerequisites
-------------

Before you start using Gardener, you may wish to check if that you have all requirements installed on your platform.

Docker 
========

Docker toolbox can be downloaded 
`here <https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/>`_.

You can verify if you have successfully installed docker running this command.


  docker ---version

Node
========
Gardener needs to have Node.js installed. Node is available and you can download it here.

Make sure you have successfully installed it by typing in command line 

  node ---version

.. note::
   Keep in mind that your Node.js version has to be at least 7.6 as gardener uses async/await pattern.
